# Convoltion-Neural-Network---Tensorflow
Building my own convolution neural network.  
Model Structure:  
Three convolution layer  
Five dense layer  
Input size (224, 224)  
Ouput size (1, 5)  
Obviously, the model is too simple. 

Using MobileNetV2  
It is much better than the previous one.  
However, the model does not converage. It can be better.
